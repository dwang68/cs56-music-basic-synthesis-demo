===============================

A basic demo of some simple synthesis starting with sine waves

# NOTE

The formats for YellowSub.txt, MaryHadALittleLamb.txt, and Default.txt are old and do not currently work as they are in incompatible format and need to be updated to use either midi, scientific name, or frequency for their pitch. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies for reference. Keep in mind that the program has been written to support octaves 1-7, but can easily be changed by editing the bounds of the for loops in FrequencyMap.java.
	
# Melody GUI Example
	ant melodyGUI

# GUI Skeleton Example Run
	ant basicGUI
		
GUI is simply a skeleton, and is not functional

# Melody of Specific File	
	 ant melody -Darg6=[filename]

Replace [filename] with any text file in build/resources. Ex:

	 ant melody -Darg6=frereJacques.txt

This uses ADSR presets: 
* attack: 0.1
* decay: 0.2 
* sustain amplitude: 0.6 
* sustain time 1.0 
* release 0.2

# Melody Run of YellowSub, MaryHadALittleLamb, and Default
	 ant melodyAll

Note: Will not work until these files are converted to the new pitch format. See the first section "NOTE".

This uses ADSR presets: 
* attack: 0.1
* decay: 0.2 
* sustain amplitude: 0.6 
* sustain time 1.0 
* release 0.2

# Melody With Full ASR Options (Single Melody File)
	 ant melodyADSR_Options -Darg0=[attack] -Darg1=[decay] -Darg2=[sustain amp] -Darg3=[sustain time] -Darg4=[release] -Darg6=[filename.txt]
	
Replace each component of -Darg with the desired value. Ex:

	 ant melodyADSR_Options -Darg0=0.1 -Darg1=0.2 -Darg2=0.3 -Darg3=0.4 -Darg4=0.5 -Darg6=frereJacques.txt

Note that -Darg5 is skipped, as it is set to '1' in build.xml

# More Options With Full Classpath
To play more than one melody in a row, use 

	java -cp build edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.music.basic_synthesis_demo.Melody_Code.Melody 0.1 0.2 0.6 1.0 0.1 3 YellowSub.txt MaryHadALittleLamb.txt Default.txt 

This will play the Melodies contained in the files YellowSub.txt, MaryHadALittleLamb.txt, and Default.txt one after another. 
The Melodies in the files will be played in the order that they are entered. All of the text files to be played must be in the build/resource/ folder.

the parameters are: attack, decay, sustain amp, sustain time, release, the number of files to play, and the names of the files containing the melodies
